   abstract = "{Varying fundamental constants (VFC) [e.g. the fine-structure constant,
        {{\alpha}}$_{EM}$] can arise in numerous extended
        cosmologies. Through their effect on the decoupling of baryons
        and photons during last scattering and reionisation, these
        models can be directly constrained using measurements of the
        cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization
        anisotropies. Previous investigations focused mainly on time-
        independent changes to the values of fundamental constants. Here
        we generalize to time-dependent variations. Instead of directly
        studying various VFC parameterizations, we perform a model-
        independent principal component analysis (PCA), directly using
        an eigenmode decomposition of the varying constant during
        recombination. After developing the formalism, we use Planck
        2018 data to obtain new VFC limits, showing that three
        independent VFC modes can be constrained at present. No
        indications for significant departures from the standard model
        are found with Planck data. Cosmic variance limited modes are
        also compared and simple forecasts for The Simons Observatory
        are carried out, showing that in the future improvements of the
        current constraints by a factor of ≃ 3 can be anticipated. Our
        modes focus solely on VFC at redshifts z {{\geq}}
        300. This implies that they do not capture some of the degrees
        of freedom relating to the reionisation era. This aspect
        provides important new insights into the possible origin of the
        Hubble tension, hinting that indeed a combined modification of
        recombination and reionisation physics could be at work. An
        extended PCA, covering both recombination and reionisation
        simultaneously, could shed more light on this question, as we
        emphasize here.}",

        These two fundamental constants directly affect the ionization
        history at redshift z ≃ 1100 and, thus, modify the temperature
        and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background
        (CMB) measured precisely with Planck . The constraints on
        {{\alpha}}$_{EM}$ tighten slightly due to improved
        Planck 2018 polarization data but otherwise remain similar to
        previous CMB analysis. However, a comparison with the 2015
        constraints reveals a mildly discordant behaviour for m$_{e}$,
        which from CMB data alone is found below its local value. Adding
        baryon acoustic oscillation data brings m$_{e}$ back to the
        fiducial value, m\_e=(1.0078{{\pm}} 0.0067) m\_e,0,

        {{\pm}} 1.2(in units of \{km s\^\{-1\} Mpc\^\{-1\}

        71.24 {{\pm}} 0.96. We perform several comparative
        analyses using the latest cosmological recombination
        calculations to further understand the various effects. Our
        results indicate that a single-parameter extension allowing a
        slightly increased value of m$_{e}$ (≃3.5{{\sigma}}
        above m$_{e, 0}$) could play a role in the Hubble tension.}"

        CMB spectral distortions probe many processes throughout the

        complements past, present and future efforts with CMB anisotropy
        and large-scale structure studies. Precision spectroscopy,

        This offers unique scientific opportunities for furthering our
        understanding of inflation, recombination, reionization and
        structure formation as well as dark matter and particle physics.
        A dedicated experimental approach could open this new window to
        the early Universe in the decades to come, allowing us to turn
        the long-standing upper distortion limits obtained with
        COBE/FIRAS some 25 years ago into clear detections of the

   abstract = "{The unparalleled precision of recent experiments such as Planck have
        allowed us to constrain standard and non-standard physics (e.g.
        due to dark matter annihilation or varying fundamental
        constants) during the recombination epoch. However, we can also
        probe this era of cosmic history using model-independent
        variations of the free electron fraction, X$_{e}$, which, in
        turn, affects the temperature and polarization anisotropies of
        the cosmic microwave background. In this paper, we improve on
        the previous efforts to construct and constrain these
        generalized perturbations in the ionization history, deriving
        new optimized eigenmodes based on the full Planck 2015
        likelihood data, introducing the new module FEAREC+. We develop
        a direct likelihood sampling method for attaining the numerical
        derivatives of the standard and non-standard parameters, and
        discuss complications arising from the stability of the
        likelihood code. We improve the amplitude constraints of the
        Planck 2015 principal components constructed here,

        {{\mu}}$_{2}$ = -0.17 {{\pm}} 0.20, and
        {{\mu}}$_{3}$ = -0.30 {{\pm}} 0.35,
        finding no indication for departures from the standard
        recombination scenario. The error constraint on the third mode
        has been improved by a factor of 2.5. We utilize an efficient
        eigenanalyser that keeps the cross-correlations of the first
        three eigenmodes to ${\rm Corr\left(\mu \, \mu ^{\prime
        }\right)} 0.1$ per cent after marginalization for all the
        considered data combinations. We also propose a new projection
        method for estimating constraints on the parameters of non-
        standard recombination scenarios. As an example, using our
        eigenmode measurements, this allows us to recreate the Planck
        constraint on the two-photon decay rate, A$_{2s1s}$ = 7.60
        {{\pm}} 0.64, giving an error estimate to within ≃
        0.05{{\sigma}} of the full MCMC result. The
        improvements on the eigenmode analysis using the Planck data
        will allow us to implement this new method for analysis with
        fundamental constant variations in the future.}",

   abstract="{The cosmological recombination radiation (CRR) is one of the inevitable
        Lambda cold dark matter spectral distortions of the cosmic
        microwave background (CMB). While it shows a rich spectral
        structure across dm-mm wavelengths, it is also one of the
        smallest signals to target. Here, we carry out a detailed
        forecast for the expected sensitivity levels required to not
        only detect but also extract cosmological information from the
        CRR in the presence of foregrounds. We use CosmoSpec to compute
        the CRR including all important radiative transfer effects and
        modifications to the recombination dynamics. We confirm that
        detections of the overall CRR signal are possible with
        spectrometer concepts like SuperPIXIE. However, for a real
        exploitation of the cosmological information, an ≃ 50 times more
        sensitive spectrometer is required. While extremely futuristic,
        this could provide independent constraints on the primordial
        helium abundance, Y$_{p}$, and probe the presence of extra
        relativistic degrees of freedom during BBN and recombination.
        Significantly improving the constraints on other cosmological
        parameters requires even higher sensitivity (another factor of
        ≃5) when considering a combination of a CMB spectrometer with
        existing CMB data. To a large part, this is due to astrophysical
        foregrounds which interestingly do not degrade the constraints
        on Y$_{p}$ and N$_{eff}$ as much. A future CMB spectrometer
        could thus open a novel way of probing non-standard BBN
        scenarios, dark radiation and sterile neutrinos. In addition,
        inflation physics could be indirectly probed using the CRR in
        combination with existing and forthcoming CMB anisotropy data.}",

        answer detailed questions about the properties of our Universe,
        targeting both standard and non-standard physics. In this paper,
        we study the effects of varying fundamental constants (i.e. the
        fine-structure constant, {{\alpha}}$_{EM}$, and
        electron rest mass, m$_{e}$) around last scattering using the
        recombination codes COSMOREC and RECFAST++. We approach the

        various effects on the free electron fraction, Thomson
        visibility function and CMB power spectra, highlighting various
        degeneracies. We demonstrate that the simpler RECFAST++
        treatment (based on a three-level atom approach) can be used to
        accurately represent the full computation of COSMOREC. We also
        include explicit time-dependent variations using a
        phenomenological power-law description. We reproduce previous
        Planck 2013 results in our analysis. Assuming constant
        variations relative to the standard values, we find the improved

        {{\pm}} 0.0036. We also discuss combined limits on
        {{\alpha}}$_{EM}$ and m$_{e}$. Our analysis shows
        that existing data are not only sensitive to the value of the
