Hello, my name is Luke and welcome! It is a bit of a work in progress but I hope that you can see some of the things I have been working on. I am currently working as a software engineer in the IPSA Working Group of TNEI Manchester, focussing on the deployment and development of the power systems software [IPSA](https://www.ipsa-power.com). Previously I was working as a cosmologist for the [Jodrell Bank Center of Astrophysics](https://www.jb.man.ac.uk) with [Jens Chluba](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~jchluba/Science/index.html), studying the cosmic microwave background, recombination and spectral distortions.

My experience in academia began studying tension quantifying methods for cosmological datasets alongside [Richard Battye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Battye) as a student intern within the University of Manchester. In 2016, I attained my M.Phys at the University of Manchester under the supervision of [Sarah Bridle](http://sarahbridle.net/), [Joe Zuntz](ttps://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/joe-zuntz) and [Michael Troxel](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/michael.troxel). In 2020, I attained my Ph.D in cosmology (_Astronomy and Astrophysics_) under the supervision of Jens Chluba.

As a researcher, I mainly focused on recombination physics, the cosmic microwave background and fundamental physics. You can see my research interests in more detail [here](/projects/research) I'm interested in sophisticated statistical methods such as principal component analysis and maximum likelihood estimators. This culminated in the development of my first software package [FEARec++](/projects/fearec) which produces functional principal components for recombination variations as well as predicting how the components can reconstruct noise constraints.

Since August 2021, I have been working on software development and maintenance for TNEI Services Ltd. where I focus on improving the source code of the [_Interactive Power Systems Analysis (IPSA)_](https://www.ipsa-power.com) software. This includes development in C++, Fortran and Python, the latter of which focusses primarily on the scripting. In this role I have developed several new original modules that will be added into the May 2022 release.
