Hello, my name is Luke and welcome to my website :-) I am currently working as a software engineer for TNEI Services Ltd., focussing on the deployment and development of the power systems software [IPSA](https://www.ipsa-power.com). Previously I was a cosmologist for the [Jodrell Bank Center of Astrophysics](https://www.jb.man.ac.uk) with [Jens Chluba](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~jchluba/Science/index.html), studying the cosmic microwave background, recombination and spectral distortions.

Originally I was studying tension quantifying methods for cosmological datasets alongside [Richard Battye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Battye) as a student intern within the University of Manchester. In 2016, I attained my Master of Physics at the University of Manchester under the supervision of [Sarah Bridle](http://sarahbridle.net/), [Joe Zuntz](ttps://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/joe-zuntz) and [Michael Troxel](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/michael.troxel). In 2020, I attained my Ph.D in cosmology under the supervision of Jens Chluba.  

As a researcher, I mainly focused on recombination physics, the cosmic microwave background and fundamental physics. You can see my research interests in more detail [here](/projects/research) I've worked on research with statistical methods such as principal component analysis and maximum likelihood estimators. This culminated in the development of my first software package [FEARec++](/projects/fearec) which produces functional principal components for recombination variations as well as predicting how the components can reconstruct noise constraints.

Since August 2021, I have been the software lead of [_IPSA_](https://www.ipsa-power.com). This has involved modification and improvement of the iteration/engineering code written in Fortran, the UI and partial-engine interface code developed in C++ and the scripting capabilities/solution building API in Python. In our team, we developed many new features for _IPSA 2.10.0_ which was released in May 2022: including updated IEEE arc flash calculations, a new Windows-10 modernised UI aesthetic, developed capability for networks parsed in CIM (Common Information Model) and the ability to quickly build units of energy storage for capability such as P28 studies.
