Back in 2015, I ran my first 10 km for [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org) after some casual runs to and from university. I found it very cathartic and enjoyed running with friends, but it did not align with my other sporting interests (I played american football for 9 years). At the start of the COVID pandemic, I stumbled back into running, starting with smaller runs like 5 km runs (I love doing [parkruns](http://parkrun.org.uk)!) and very quickly started running 10 km, half marathon and eventually tried my first 20 mile run! Here is a widget that shows the latest efforts of my runs from Strava:

In 2021, I ran the London Marathon for [NOMAN Is An Island](https://nomancampaign.org), raising [Â£3,000](https://www.justgiving.com/lukenoman) for the charity. The London Marathon is an exceptional event because of the amazing crowds and has turned a vice, running to avoid the woes of the COVID pandemic; into an obsession - something that I consistently do every week.
